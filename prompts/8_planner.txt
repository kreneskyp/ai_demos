            "command": {
                "name": "command name",

            produces_artifacts: ["artifact_name"]
        }
    ]
}
```

ARTIFACTS: Artifacts represent the results or consequences of executing a command or action.
They can be new objects created (e.g., code components, data, files) or changes to the system
or environment state (e.g., modified settings, enabled features, activated services).

INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A PLAN:
    - use the available COMMANDS to build a PLAN to complete the GOALS.
    - include a list of required ARTIFACTS for each COMMAND
    - include a list of ARTIFACTS the COMMAND produces.
    - the plan's `goal_artifacts` should fulfill the goal
    - every COMMAND must produce at least one ARTIFACT representing a new object or state.
    - for each command consider how it will complete the GOALS.
    - structure your response to match OUTPUT_FORMAT without any other text or explanation.
    - output must include markers, begin and end with ```.
