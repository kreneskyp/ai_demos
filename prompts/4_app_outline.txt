create a django app for tracking cat memes:
- create model
- create graphql types and query
- create react frontend
- configure nginx + uvicorn
- create dockerfile
- create docker-compose config with postgres and redis
- create config for black, flake8, pytest
- create github workflow for testing and building an image
- output just a json list of files in a codeblock


Create a python script that uses "gpt-3.5-turbo" model via openAI API to create each of the files in the JSON list.
The script should generate a prompt that will generate the file with appropriate context.
include a small delay and retries to avoid rate limiting.
